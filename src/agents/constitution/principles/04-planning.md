# Principle IV: Comprehensive Planning

**Version**: 4.0.0 | **Part of**: [Constitution](../INDEX.md) > Core Principles

**Related**: [Planning Quick Reference](../references/planning-ref.md), [Spec-Driven Development](03-spec-driven.md)

**Prerequisites**: Understand [Step](../glossary.md#step) and [Trivial Task](../glossary.md#trivial-task) definitions

---

## Guideline

Planning requirements scale with task complexity.

---

## Planning Organization

### File Structure

Planning documents **MAY** be organized as multiple files in folders when complexity requires or when the planning exceeds token-efficient limits.

**Single File** (Default for Simple/Moderate):
```
.plans/
└── NNNN_task.md (all planning content)
```

**Multi-File** (For Complex planning or when plan.md exceeds 200 lines):
```
specs/###-feature-name/
├── plan.md (overview + navigation)
├── research/
│   ├── technical-decisions.md
│   ├── architecture-analysis.md
│   └── dependency-evaluation.md
├── design/
│   ├── data-model.md
│   ├── api-contracts.yaml
│   └── component-design.md
├── execution/
│   ├── phase1-setup.md
│   ├── phase2-implementation.md
│   └── phase3-validation.md
└── checklists/
    ├── requirements.md
    ├── security.md
    └── performance.md
```

**Organization Rules**:
- Each file MUST be ≤200 lines (Principle VIII)
- plan.md serves as navigation hub
- Folders group related planning artifacts
- Use multi-file for complex features requiring specification
- Simple/Moderate tasks use single .plans/ file

## Graduated Planning Levels

### Trivial (1-2 steps, <15 min)

**Planning**: None required
**Documentation**: Inline TODO comments acceptable
**File Structure**: N/A
**Examples**:
- Fix typo in documentation
- Update config value
- Add single log statement
- Rename variable for clarity

**When to Use**: All criteria in [Trivial Task](../glossary.md#trivial-task) met

---

### Simple (3-5 steps, 15-60 min)

**Planning**: Single file `.plans/NNNN_task.md`
**File Structure**: Single file only

**Contents**:
- Goal and approach (1-2 paragraphs)
- Steps (numbered list)
- MCP servers to use
- Success criteria

**Examples**:
- Add logging to module
- Update dependency
- Fix straightforward bug
- Add simple validation

**Template**:
```markdown
# Task NNNN: [Task Name]

## Goal
[What are we trying to achieve?]

## Approach
[How will we do it?]

## Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## MCP Servers
- [Server 1]: [Usage]
- [Server 2]: [Usage]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
```

---

### Moderate (6-10 steps, 1-4 hours)

**Planning**: Two documents
**File Structure**: Single file `.plans/` OR multi-file if exceeds 200 lines

**Single File Option** (Default):
```
.plans/
├── NNNN_initial.md
└── NNNN_revised.md
```

**Multi-File Option** (If planning exceeds limits):
```
.plans/NNNN/
├── 01_initial_plan.md
├── 02_revised_plan.md
└── artifacts/
    ├── dependencies.md
    └── risks.md
```

**Contents**:
- **01_initial_plan.md**: First understanding, high-level approach, initial steps, known challenges
- **02_revised_plan.md**: Detailed steps, MCP mapping, dependencies, risk mitigation, success criteria

**Examples**:
- Refactor module for testability
- Add feature with tests
- Implement API endpoint
- Database schema migration

---

### Complex (11+ steps, >4 hours)

**Planning**: Multi-file structure (REQUIRED for spec-driven features)
**File Structure**: Organized folders under `specs/###-feature-name/`

**Recommended Structure**:
```
specs/###-feature-name/
├── plan.md (overview + navigation hub)
├── research.md (Phase 0: technical decisions)
├── data-model.md (Phase 1: entity design)
├── quickstart.md (Phase 1: integration scenarios)
├── tasks.md (Phase 2: actionable task breakdown)
├── contracts/ (Phase 1: API contracts)
│   ├── api-endpoints.yaml
│   └── data-schemas.json
└── checklists/ (Phase 1: quality gates)
    ├── requirements.md
    ├── security.md
    └── performance.md
```

**Alternative for .plans/** (Non-spec features):
```
.plans/NNNN/
├── 01_initial_plan.md
├── 02_revised_plan.md
├── 03_mcp_usage_plan.md
├── 04_execution_log.md
└── artifacts/
    ├── research-notes.md
    └── decisions.md
```

**Organization Rules**:
- Each file MUST be ≤200 lines
- Use `specs/` for features requiring specifications (Production Code)
- Use `.plans/` for internal refactorings (Infrastructure Code)
- plan.md serves as navigation hub with links to all artifacts
- Folders group related content logically

**Examples**:
- New feature with specification
- Major refactoring
- Multi-component integration
- Performance optimization

---

## What Counts as a "Step"?

See [Glossary: Step](../glossary.md#step) for full definition.

**Quick Check** - A step is:
- Single tool invocation
- Produces measurable output
- Can be verified complete/incomplete
- Execution time: <5 minutes

**Examples**:
- Read file = 1 step
- Run tests = 1 step
- Update spec = 1 step
- Make architectural decision = 1 step

---

## Planning Decision Tree

```
Estimate steps and time:
├─ 1-2 steps, <15 min → Trivial (no plan)
├─ 3-5 steps, 15-60 min → Simple (1 file)
├─ 6-10 steps, 1-4 hr → Moderate (2 files)
└─ 11+ steps, >4 hr → Complex (4 files)
```

**If uncertain**: Start with Simple plan, upgrade to Moderate/Complex if needed.

## Planning Anti-Patterns

❌ **Over-planning trivial tasks** - Creates overhead
❌ **Under-planning complex tasks** - Leads to confusion
❌ **Not updating plans** - Plans become stale
❌ **Skipping execution logs** - Lose learning value
❌ **No retrospective analysis** - Miss improvement opportunities

## Context Budget Planning

For AI-assisted development, manage context window efficiently by planning what information the AI needs at each stage.

### Context Categories

#### Must-Have Context (20% of window)
Essential information for the current task:
- Files being modified
- Direct dependencies
- Interfaces being implemented
- Tests for current code
- Specifications being followed

#### Should-Have Context (30% of window)
Supporting information that improves quality:
- Related modules in same feature
- Parent classes/abstractions
- Configuration files
- Similar implementations for reference
- Recent execution logs

#### Optional Context (50% reserve)
Nice-to-have for comprehensive understanding:
- Documentation
- Historical decisions (ADRs)
- Similar features in codebase
- External API documentation
- Performance benchmarks

### Planning Context Usage

In your planning documents, explicitly specify context needs:

```markdown
## Context Budget Plan

### Must-Have (20%)
- user/validators.py (current file)
- user/models.py (data structures)
- tests/test_validators.py (test cases)

### Should-Have (30%)
- user/service.py (usage context)
- user/controller.py (API layer)
- config/validation.yaml (rules)

### Reserve (50%)
- Keep for AI's working memory
- Dynamic loading as needed
```

### Context Loading Strategy

1. **Start Minimal**: Load only must-have context
2. **Add Progressively**: Load should-have as needed
3. **Reserve Space**: Keep 50% for AI operations
4. **Unload Aggressively**: Remove context when done

### Context Optimization Tips

**DO:**
- Use vertical slices to reduce cross-file needs
- Load test files with implementation files
- Prioritize interfaces over implementations
- Use summaries for large files

**DON'T:**
- Load entire directories
- Include generated code
- Load all tests for one file change
- Keep historical versions in context

### Measuring Context Efficiency

Track these metrics:
```python
# In execution logs
context_metrics = {
    "files_loaded": 12,
    "total_tokens": 45000,
    "must_have_tokens": 9000,    # Should be ~20%
    "should_have_tokens": 13500,  # Should be ~30%
    "reserve_used": 22500,        # Should be ~50%
    "task_completed": True,
    "context_reloads": 2          # Minimize this
}
```

### Context Budget Templates

Add to planning templates:

**Simple Plan Addition**:
```markdown
## Context Budget
- Must: [list files]
- Should: [list files]
- Reserve: 50%
```

**Moderate/Complex Plan Addition**:
```markdown
## Context Budget Planning

### Initial Load
Must-Have:
- file1.py (why needed)
- file2.py (why needed)

### Progressive Load
Step 3: Add file3.py
Step 5: Replace file1.py with file4.py
Step 8: Clear all except tests
```
