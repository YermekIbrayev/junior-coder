  - TDD: Test-Driven Development - User wants to write tests first, then implement
  - RETRO: Retrospective Analysis - User wants to analyze past work, extract learnings
  - GENERAL: General Question - User has a question that doesn't fit development workflows
  - UNCLEAR: Intent is unclear and needs clarification

  Respond with JSON format:
  {
    "intent": "SDD|TDD|RETRO|GENERAL|UNCLEAR",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,

  The user's intent is unclear. Ask a clarifying question to understand what they need.

  Be specific and provide options when possible. For example:
  - "Would you like to: (1) Create a specification, (2) Write tests, or (3) Analyze past work?"
  - "Can you clarify what you're trying to accomplish?"

  Keep the question concise and helpful.
